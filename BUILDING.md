# Building

Requires the .NET 8 SDK and Python 3. The mod targets .NET 6; tests run on .NET 8.
Launch Schedule I with MelonLoader once to generate its IL2CPP assemblies.

Set the MelonLoader path to the directory containing both `net6` and
`Il2CppAssemblies`. These game and loader dependencies stay on your machine.

## Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$loader = "C:\path\to\profile\MelonLoader"
dotnet build ModSettings.csproj --configuration Release "-p:MelonLoaderDir=$loader"
dotnet run --project tests/Tests.csproj
python package.py --prepare
```

## Linux / Nix

```sh
MELONLOADER_DIR='/path/to/profile/MelonLoader' ./build.sh
nix-shell -p dotnet-sdk_8 --run 'dotnet run --project tests/Tests.csproj'
```

The DLL is written to `bin/Release/net6.0/`. Packaging produces a Thunderstore ZIP
in `dist/`. Run `python package.py --prepare` after building to copy the DLL into
`package/` and create the ZIP. Commit that DLL alongside its source changes.
The `bin/` and `dist/` directories remain ignored.

## Formatting

Set `MelonLoaderDir` as an environment variable when formatting the main project:
`MelonLoaderDir=/path/to/profile/MelonLoader dotnet format ModSettings.csproj`
on Linux, or set `$env:MelonLoaderDir` in PowerShell before running the formatter.
Run `dotnet format tests/Tests.csproj` for tests and `ruff format package.py`
for the packaging script.

See [development notes](DEVELOPMENT.md) for implementation details and in-game checks.

## GitHub Actions

`Package and publish` runs standalone tests and release-metadata checks on pull requests.
Pushes to main and manual runs also package the committed DLL into a validated
Thunderstore ZIP. Download the `thunderstore-package` artifact from the run and
extract the mod ZIP inside. Artifacts expire after 30 days.

CI packages `package/ModSettings.dll`; it does not compile the mod or need game
references. Rebuild locally and run `python package.py --prepare` whenever the mod
source changes. CI tests source code separately; those tests do not prove the committed
DLL matches that source or that multiplayer works.

## Publishing

1. Update the version in the project, package manifest and MelonInfo attribute together.
2. Build locally, run tests, then run `python package.py --prepare`.
3. Commit and push the source, metadata and refreshed `package/ModSettings.dll`.
4. Create and push a matching `vX.Y.Z` tag.

**Pushing the version tag publishes to Thunderstore automatically** after checks and
packaging pass. Main-branch pushes and manual runs only create ZIP artifacts.
The tag must match the manifest version.

Publishing uses the existing `TCLI_AUTH_TOKEN` Actions secret and official
`tcli` 0.2.4, uploading the exact ZIP artifact to `holyfurries` / `schedule-i`.
No private reference repository or reference token is needed.

Existing Thunderstore versions cannot be replaced; bump the version for each release.
If an upload fails, check Thunderstore before rerunning the workflow.
